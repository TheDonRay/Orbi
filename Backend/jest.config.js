// This file is for if i want to add the jest coverage to see if code is covered by tests etc.  
// commenting out this module exports so that it just runs as npm t without the coverage for now.  so just regular jest without the test coverage chart showing. 

// module.exports = { 
//     collectCoverage: true, 
//     collectCoverageFrom: ["name of where the file is that you want to test or routes etc/**/*.js"],
//     coverageDirectory: "coverage", 
//     testMatch: ["**/tests/**/*.test.js"], 
// };
